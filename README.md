# Red Crimson Wood

Has it ever come to your mind that Crimson wood is called Crimson, but its actually more on the purple side? Whilst the leaves and bark of Crimson trees is red, the wooden planks and other materials derived from Crimson wood has a purple-y hue. Now, I don't know about you, but I think this needs a little bit of continuity...

Red Crimson Wood simply recolors all of the purple Crimson wood materials, from signs to doors to stripped logs.

## Alternatives
Not a fan of this pack's approach, but want a similar experience? [Vanilla Tweaks](https://vanillatweaks.net) has a *Crimsoner Crimson* pack on their amazing Resource Pack picker, creepermax123 [has one on Planet Minecraft](https://www.planetminecraft.com/texture-pack/better-crimson-wood/), or you could try one of the many ones posted to the r/Minecraft subreddit, such as [this one](https://reddit.com/r/Minecraft/comments/iarkeh).

Or, if you want to swing in completely the opposite direction, I recommend Pythagoras' [Purpler Crimson Wood](https://www.planetminecraft.com/texture-pack/purpler-crimson-wood/)!
