# Red Crimson Wood

Has it ever come to your mind that Crimson wood is called Crimson, but its actually more on the purple side? Whilst the leaves and bark of Crimson trees is red, the wooden planks and other materials derived from Crimson wood has a purple-y hue. Now, I don't know about you, but I think this needs a little bit of continuity...

Red Crimson Wood simply recolors all of the purple Crimson wood materials, from signs to doors to stripped logs.
